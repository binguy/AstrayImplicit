# Astray Implicit

The research experiment x2 of WebGL maze game called Astray built with Three.js and Box2dWeb for my paper. You can checkout the original Astray here: http://wwwtyro.github.io/Astray/. You can play my version at https://mybingamer.github.io/AstrayImplicit

There are several ways to launch the game. Here is the simplest:

1. Clone or download the repository

3. Start 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' in your shell (for python 3.0 and above type 'python -m http.server' in your shell)
4. Open 'localhost:8000' in your browser
